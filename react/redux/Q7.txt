What are the things which we should never do inside a reducer?.

Mutate the state directly

// Don't mutate the state directly
state.todos.push(action.payload);
return state;

// Create a new state object and return it
return {
  ...state,
  todos: [...state.todos, action.payload]
};


Perform asynchronous operations Reducers should be synchronous and handle state changes based on the dispatched actions. Performing asynchronous operations, such as API calls or timeouts, directly inside a reducer is not appropriate. Use middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga to handle asynchronous actions.

Access the DOM: Reducers should not have any knowledge or interaction with the DOM. They should remain independent of the UI layer and focus on state management.
