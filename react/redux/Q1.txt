In Redux's architecture, an action is a plain JavaScript object that describes an intention to change the state of an application. It represents a specific event or user interaction and carries the necessary information to perform the state update

An action typically has two properties:

type: A string that describes the type of action being performed. It serves as a unique identifier for the action and is usually defined as a constant value to ensure consistency across the application.

payload: Additional data or information associated with the action. It provides the necessary details to update the state based on the action.

const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO';

const addTodo = (text) => {
  return {
    type: ADD_TODO,
    payload: {
      text: text,
      completed: false
    }
  };
};
