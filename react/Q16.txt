it is first callled during the mounting stage and then we could conditionally decide the invoing of the useEffect state ourselves.

we could also called the used effect during the unmountiong stage by giveng it return function inside it

useEffect=(()=>{

    logic

    return ()=>{
        cleanup function called after unmounting of the components
    }
},[dependencies])
