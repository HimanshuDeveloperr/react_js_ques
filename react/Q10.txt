Prop drilling is a term used in React to describe the process of passing props through multiple layers of components to reach a deeply nested child component that needs access to those props. It occurs when intermediate components do not require the props but need to pass them down to child components.


Context API The Context API allows you to create a shared state that can be accessed by multiple components without passing props explicitly

Redux: Redux is a state management library that centralizes the application state in a global store. It provides a way to access the state from any component without prop drilling.
