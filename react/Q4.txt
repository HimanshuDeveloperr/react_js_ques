state variable are the ones which are mutable and effects the components rendering when the state updates the whole component re-renders itself picking the new data of that variable.

state variables are accessable from within the component it is declared

normal variable are exact opposite of this state variables they are immutable and had a accessibility from where they are derived and we wont be munting the dom when the normal variables gets udated.


state variables are to be used when u need to update the data during the lifecycle of the components
