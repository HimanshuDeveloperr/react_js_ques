- Keys in React are special attributes used to provide a unique identity to elements in a list when rendering dynamically.
- They enable React to efficiently update, reorder, or delete specific elements in a list without re-rendering the entire list.
- The advantages of using keys are efficient reconciliation, stable component identity, and improved performance.
- Keys should be unique and stable identifiers associated with each item in the list.
- Providing keys is recommended when rendering lists of components in React to optimize performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
