In React, the return statement of a functional component is called whenever the component is rendered or re-rendered. The return statement defines the structure and content of the component's output, which is typically rendered as HTML or JSX.

When a functional component is initially rendered, or when its state or props change, React triggers a re-render of the component. During this re-render, the function body of the component is executed, including the return statement. The return statement determines what JSX or elements should be rendered as the output of the component.


import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const message = 'Hello, world!';
  return <div>{message}</div>;
}
