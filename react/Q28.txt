Declarative approach: React's declarative syntax simplifies UI development by describing how the UI should look based on the current state, abstracting away manual DOM manipulation.
Virtual DOM and efficient updates: React's virtual DOM efficiently calculates and performs minimal updates to the actual DOM, improving rendering performance by reducing expensive DOM manipulations.
Component-based architecture: React promotes reusable and modular components, enhancing code reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.
One-way data flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow, making it easier to understand and debug how data changes propagate through the application and maintaining predictable application state.
