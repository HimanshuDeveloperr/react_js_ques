Memoization: Memoization is a technique that caches the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This can help optimize expensive computations or calculations in a component

import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

function ExpensiveComponent({ data }) {
  const processedData = useMemo(() => {
    // Expensive computation or data processing
    return processData(data);
  }, [data]);

  return <div>{processedData}</div>;
}






Virtualization: Virtualization is the technique of rendering only the visible portion of a large list or data set, rather than rendering all items at once. This approach reduces the initial rendering time and improves scrolling performance.






Code Splitting: Code splitting involves splitting your JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks, allowing the browser to load only the necessary code for a particular route or component. This can reduce the initial load time and improve performance.
