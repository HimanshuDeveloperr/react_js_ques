The Context API in React is a feature that allows you to manage global state and share data between components without having to pass props down manually through every level of the component tree. It provides a way to pass data through the component tree without using props explicitly.

The Context API works based on two main components: the Provider and the Consumer.

The Provider component defines the context and provides the data or state to be shared. It wraps the components that need access to the context data.
The Consumer component is used within the child components to access the shared data from the Provider. It allows consuming the context values and utilizing them within the component
